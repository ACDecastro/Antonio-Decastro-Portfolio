                    I'm a graduate of McDaniel College in Westminster, MD. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration.
                    <br><br>
                    While studying, Java was my main programming language, but I also worked with a small bit of Python. I worked on Raspberry Pi devices, cloud computing with Amazon EC2, and some Android App Development.
                    <br><br>
                    At the same time, I also worked at the McDaniel College I.T. Support Help Desk where I helped students and staff create school email accounts, reset passwords, install computers and printers, and troubleshoot computer problems. 
                    <br><br> 
                    During my last year of school, I also worked at a local business in Westminster where I installed ethernet ports in their building,repaired computers, and helped make a point-of-sale system using Odoo, among other duties.
                    <br><br>
                    As the COVID-19 pandemic forced schools across the country to move to remote learning, I worked with Pansophic Learning to support school systems in Ohio, California, and Michigan in their efforts to have instructors and students teach and learn from home.
